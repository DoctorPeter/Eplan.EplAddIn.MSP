This document provides an overview of the EPLAN AddIn designed to generate Motor Starter Circuits with Protection Devices. Users can configure settings via a dedicated configuration window, allowing for customized circuit generation based on specific requirements.

## Features
- **Protection Types**: Choose between different protection devices such as circuit breakers and fuses.
- **Order Numbers**: Select from predefined order numbers for components.
- **Start Types**: Configure start types including Direct On Line (DOL) and Reversing Direct On Line (RDOL).
- **Motor Power**: Specify the nominal power of the motor.
- **Clamps**: Option to include or exclude clamps in the circuit.

## Installation
